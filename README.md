CTGUI
=====

**This binding is no longber being actively developed. There are currently no plans to update it to TGUI 0.9**

CTGUI is a C binding for the [TGUI library](https://github.com/texus/TGUI), a cross-platform GUI for SFML.

Although it is possible to use it directly in a C program, it was created to simplify other bindings such as the [.Net binding](https://github.com/texus/TGUI.Net).
