CTGUI
=====

**This binding is currently being updated from TGUI 0.8 to TGUI 1.x and therefore still lacks features**

CTGUI is a C binding for the [TGUI library](https://github.com/texus/TGUI), a cross-platform c++ GUI.

It is intended to simplify creating bindings for TGUI in other languages, but it is also possible to use CTGUI directly in a C program.
